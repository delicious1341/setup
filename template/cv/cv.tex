\section{Academia}
\textbf{Bachelor's Degree Natural Sciences Tripos, University of Cambridge}, 07/2022

\begin{itemize}
	\item[]Physics (3yrs), Mathematics (2yrs), Chemistry (2yrs), Material Science (1yr)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Literature Research Review} produced under Dr S E Dutton of Dutton Research Group, 05/2022

\textit{Improvements in Performance of All Solid State Batteries Through Research on Interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Interrogated primary literature via the web and library resources.
	\item Developed the critical faculties to summarise, explain and present an informed view of the state of knowledge in the research field. Distinguishing between widely known/accepted views and more speculative/less developed theories.
	\item Presented the work in an appropriate style: in formal writing (utilising LaTeX text-processing package) and orally (in an interview presentation to professors).
\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Experiments} conducted under: Dr Tijmen Euser of the NanoPhotonics Centre, 12/2021; Dr David Ward, 03/2021

\textit{Coherence and Information in a Fibre Interferometer}

\textit{Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy: Oxidation of Graphite: Kinetics on the Atomic Scale}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Computed simulations from theoretical literature contrasted with experimental results.
	\item Collected data from niche devices to analyse with Python, but also specialist software too
	\item Devised experiments to: test established theory, verify equipment specifications, investigate
		physics of fringe cases and isolate behaviour in differing time scales
	\item Automated data collection and deduced suitable sampling windows to account for errors
\end{itemize}


\section{Employment}
\textbf{Tax Accountant} at  Justa \& Co. Certified Chartered Acountants Ltd., 02/2023

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculated and Submitted Capital Gain Returns for sales of properties and cryptoassets in
		accordance with HMRC policies and maximising allowances for tax-efficiency.	
	\item Created a faster workflow for processing bank statements, invoices and ledgers to be
		coded and integrated into the existing Sage accounting software environment.
	\item Optimised Excel spreadsheet templates for tripling processing speed \& stability and added
		documentation for subsequent annual adjustments to tax allowances.
	\item Established a server archival system for client documents received from client meetings,
		postage, emails and messaging apps, solving a backlog issue of >1000 clients.
	\item Took interim managerial role of Personal Tax department in senior manager absence in the
